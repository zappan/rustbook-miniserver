# Rust Book WebServer Excercise

This is a web server excercise from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
which I went through and played with that code alongside reading through the book. It
contains the trivial implementation of a web server in Rust, mainly following what the
book provided, though it may be slighly modified to satisfy my learning curiosity and
trying the extra possibilities of the language.

This is mostly intended to be a self-reference, but if anyone finds it interesting you
may freely use it for your own reference.
